            <div><h2>Deliver a Better Credit Experience to Ease Lender Stress</h2></div>
            <p>
            Home mortgage is painful. Not only for borrowers, but also for lenders who work through the mounds of paperwork. As part of the process, credit score has the highest impact on loan approval. However, the current credit experience is being challenged by the disparated workflow, manual documentation process, and poor communication with borrowers. <br><br>

            With major banking clients such as JP Morgan Chase, TD Bank, HSBC, etc, Roostify is reinventing the home mortgage experience through a streamlined and automated digital mortgage platform. Our goal is to ease lender stress by providing a more integrated, guided and collaborative credit  experience, and ultimately, accelerate loan approval.

        <p>I am leading the design of the credit service including user research, prototyping and visual design.

        <div><h2>Our Users</h2></div>
        <p>In the mortgage process, the credit check is initiated and completed by the lenders. As a result, we focused on leveraging the credit experience for lenders. However, smoothing out the borrower-facing steps can significantly  accelerate the process and build the relationship between lenders and borrowers. </p>

        <div><h2>Insights from the Loan Officers</h2></div>
        <p>We interviewed 5 loan officers around their experience pulling credit. Our goals were to understand their current process and the challenges they face.</p>
        <h3>Reading of the credit report is furstrating</h3>
        <p>
        The current credit report for lenders is long-winded and frustrating,causing the loan officers to often miss the details they want to catch or misinterpret the information.

        </p> 
        <h3>Credit report as a communication channel</h3>
        <p>
        By compliance, lenders are not allowed to share the credit report with borrowers. Instead, they are always on their phone talking through the items in the credit report that raise concerns.  
        </p> 
        <h3>Follow ups surrounding a credit check is intense
 </h3>
        <p>
        
        Credit score is not the only deciding factor for loan approval. Ancillary follow-up actions and additional communication can be a burden to loan officers due to the manual processing. 
        </p> 
        <h3>Disjoints as a loan evolves</h3>
          
        <p>
         The loan officers constantly switch between multiple systems to perform various tasks. Repeating keying data results in hard stops in their workflow.

        <h2>It takes more than a look at the score</h2>
        <p>Seeing  a 720+ score is definitely the most exciting moment for lenders. However, most borrowers do not have, or are close to the satisfying score. Scrutinizing every single line of credit, requesting documents from borrowers, handing off data to the downstream can cause stress, anxiety and uncertainty in lenders’ workflow.<br>Understanding the major pain for lenders, I proposed the following goals to guide the design:</p>

        <div><h2>Ease the pain of reading </h2></div>
        <p>Understanding what loan officers are dealing with is important to build the context. The existing credit reports (lender version) remain the PDF manner as years ago. The poorly structured content and a lack of visual focus bury the key information beneath.
To validate our assumptions , we had a semi-structured interview with loan officers to understand what is important essentially for them to complete their work. </p>

        <div><h2>Bring the holistic view to the front </h2></div>
        <p>Aiming to bring a focus and leave the niggling  details behind, I restructured the content into 4 sections that are essential to loan officers’ decision making. The tabs design was introduced to offer a full picture of the borrower’s credit history instantly, and to adapt to their reading habit: dig into the very bottom of the information when necessary. </p>

        <p>One interesting finding we observed during testing was, loan officers are quite used to vertially scrolling through the 20 page PDF instead of switching horizontally between tabs. The new design utilizes the tab to navigate to different scores and sections. However, it is easy for loan officers to miss the information hidden, and hard to tell the functionality of each tabs.
        <br><br>
        Part of the project was also taking into consideration the multiple borrower requirement. When there are multiple borrowers in the application, the complexity also increases when loan officers have to

        <p>The loan officers do not work at a normal schedule. They often get contacted during nights and weekends, when they are not in front of their laptop. Our data revealed that 50% of the visits were from mobile, which calls for a more desirable and accessible mobile view to leverage their daily work.
            While developing a consistent rule is needed across devices for easier information retrieval, a more suitable  content strategy has to be achieved to bring user focus.</p>
