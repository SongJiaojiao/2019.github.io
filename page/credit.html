        <div><h2>Deliver a Better Credit Experience to Ease Lender Stress</h2></div>
        <p>
       Home mortgage is painful. Not only for borrowers, but also for lenders who work through the mounds of paperwork.  While borrowers are looking for a loan approval, lenders are seeking to close the deal. As part of the process, credit score has the highest impact on loan approval. However, the current credit experience is being challenged by the disparated workflow, manual documentation process, and poor communication with borrowers. <br><br>

With major banking clients such as JP Morgan Chase, TD Bank, HSBC, etc, Roostify is reinventing the home mortgage experience through a streamlined and automated digital mortgage platform. Our goal is to ease lender stress by providing a more integrated, guided and collaborative credit  experience, and ultimately, accelerate loan approval.

        <div><h2>My Role</h2></div>
        <p>I am leading the design of the credit service including user research, prototyping and visual design. I am collaborating with a product manager, three engineers in delivering the credit service, alongside 3 other designers in refining the design system that is related to this project.<br>The product is currently under development.</p>

        <p class = "guide">Research</p>
        <div><h2>Our Users</h2></div>
        <p>In the mortgage process, the credit check is initiated and completed by the lenders. As a result, we focused on leveraging the credit experience for lenders. However, smoothing out the borrower-facing steps can significantly  accelerate the process and build the relationship between lenders and borrowers. </p>

        <div><h2>Insights from the Loan Officers</h2></div>
        <p>We interviewed 5 loan officers around their experience pulling credit. Our goals were to understand their current process and the challenges they face.</p>
        <h3>Reading of the credit report is furstrating</h3>
        <p>
        The current credit report for lenders is long-winded and frustrating,causing the loan officers to often miss the details they want to catch or misinterpret the information.

        </p> 
        <h3>Credit report as a communication channel</h3>
        <p>
        By compliance, lenders are not allowed to share the credit report with borrowers. Instead, they are always on their phone talking through the items in the credit report that raise concerns.  
        </p> 
        <h3>Follow ups surrounding a credit check is intense
 </h3>
        <p>
        
        Credit score is not the only deciding factor for loan approval. Ancillary follow-up actions and additional communication can be a burden to loan officers due to the manual processing. 
        </p> 
        <h3>Disjoints as a loan evolves</h3>
          
        <p>
         The loan officers constantly switch between multiple systems to perform various tasks. Repeating keying data results in hard stops in their workflow.

        <p class = "guide">Framing the problem</p>
        <h2>It takes more than a look at the score</h2>
        <p>Seeing  a 720+ score is definitely the most exciting moment for lenders. However, most borrowers do not have, or are close to the satisfying score. Scrutinizing every single line of credit, requesting documents from borrowers, handing off data to the downstream can cause stress, anxiety and uncertainty in lenders’ workflow.<br>Understanding the major pain for lenders, I proposed the following goals to guide the design:</p>

        <h2>Bringing More Focus on What's Important</h2>   
        <p>Say Goodbuy to the dated PDF. The new credit report brings a simplified view with clarify and focus. The most critical information is brought to the front while the full details is available when necessary.  </p>

<div class="strip">   
        <h2>Multi-borrower & single borrower view</h2>   
        <p>Joint credit reports come with combined lines of credit history. However, loan officers often times need to check their credit history separately to potentially remove co borrower(s) so as to boost the credit score. Allowing them toggling between a multiple borrower and single borrower view saves the trouble of a notepad at hand.  </p>

        <h2>Review Anytime, Anywhere</h2>   
        <p>Loan officers often get last minute requests from borrowers, during evenings and weekends. We understand the circumstances and give loan officers time back by allowing rapid retrieval of the credit information while they are often distracted.</p>

<div class="strip">   
        <div><h2>Ease the pain of reading </h2></div>
        <p>Understanding what loan officers are dealing with is important to build the context. The existing credit reports (lender version) remain the PDF manner as years ago. The poorly structured content and a lack of visual focus bury the key information beneath.
To validate our assumptions , we had a semi-structured interview with loan officers to understand what is important essentially for them to complete their work.

        <div><h2>Bring the holistic view to the front </h2></div>
        <p>Aiming to bring a focus and leave the niggling  details behind, I restructured the content into 4 sections that are essential to loan officers’ decision making. The tabs design was introduced to offer a full picture of the borrower’s credit history instantly, and to adapt to their reading habit: dig into the very bottom of the information when necessary. </p>

        <div><h2>The change in user behaviour</h2></div>
        <p>One interesting finding we observed during testing was, loan officers are quite used to scrolling through  the 20 page PDF.  Switching horizontally between tabs is a brand new design pattern for them while they like everything to be laid out vertically.

        <p>It's a common pratice to apply jointly as a married couple. </p>

</div>
<div class="strip">   
        <p>This problem became more complicated when it comes to multiple borrower scenario: when there is more than one tab on the page, and sometimes the loan officers are confused about the functionality of each tab.

<div class="strip">   
        <div><h2>Review credit on the go</h2></div>
        <p>The loan officers do not work at a normal schedule. They often get contacted during nights and weekends, when they are not in front of their laptop. Our data revealed that 50% of the visits were from mobile, which calls for the need to design a more desirable and accessible mobile view to leverage their daily work.
While developing a consistent rule is needed across devices for easier information retrieval, a more suitable  context strategy has to be achieved to bring user focus.

        <div><h2>Automate the manual steps</h2></div>
        <p>Getting the credit report only opens the initial conversation with borrowers. To have an overall financial picture of the borrower, there is more work needs to be done: </p>
        <ul class="list-group" ty>
            <li class="list-group-item">1. Loan officers request a letter of explanation if there is anything that needs explaining.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">2. Loan officers will mark the debts that will be paid off to lower borrower’s debt obligation to improve their chance of getting approved.</li>

        </ul>
<br>

    <p>A lot of time is wasted in manually drafting emails and communicating back and forth with borrowers. We want to free the loan officers from the manual steps and focus on what’s really important. Based in the user interview with loan officers, I proposed the workflow below. Without the need to manually draft an email and having borrowers figuring out the format by themselves, we want to automate this process and reduce the anxiety in this process.
